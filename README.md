# cognition

SPA Javascript component framework for making SPA's in Javascript.

## Links

Here's the [cognition-framework](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cognition-framework)
package on npm.

We put together a quick project boilerplate and build system that will set up
a project structure and  serve it for you.  That's called
[cognition-kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cognition-kit). Give that a spin.

[@landonb](https://twitter.com/landonb) tends to live in the shadows, but he'll
help, too if you ask nice.

## The Basics

_We're working on actual docs, promise._ Two minutes, Turkish.

### Cogs

Each `.html` file in the project's src tree is one component, or cog.
